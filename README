Django Endless Pagination can be used to provide Twitter-style or
Digg-style pagination, with optional Ajax support and other features
like multiple or lazy pagination.

The initial idea, which has guided the development of this application,
is to allow pagination of web contents in `very few steps
<http://django-endless-pagination.readthedocs.org/en/latest/start.html>`_.

`Documentation is avaliable online
<http://django-endless-pagination.readthedocs.org/>`_, or in the docs
directory of the project.
