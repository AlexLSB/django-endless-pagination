Hacking Django Endless Pagination
=================================

Steps needed to set up a development and testing environment.


Create a development environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the root of this branch, run the command::

  $ make develop

This command will create a ``.venv`` directory in the branch root, ignored
by DVCS, containing the development virtual environment with all the
dependencies.


Testing and debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the tests and lint checks::

  $ make check
